# Netflix-cln-react
A project to learn fundamentals of React.js:

In this project I built a clone of the website netflix.com using react.js
Visit the project site here: https://react-netflix-clone-767a3.web.app

The movies on the website automatically update to the latest movies.
Click on a movie to view a trailer, some movie do not have a trailer.

Upcoming bug fixes and updates to be made.
